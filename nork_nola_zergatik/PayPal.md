* *"Our new approach was all about rapid iteration."*

* *"[...] our customer facing applications began to get dated."*

* *"Open source is our new mantra. Our predecessor technology stacks were built to provide good value, but were done in a proprietary manner. This resulted in weeks of training for a new hire to learn our technologies."*

* *"Both Node.js and its community are still young though, so there were gaps we faced where we felt there was a better way to do it. In this case, we were excited to contribute that code back to the community and help grow it instead of writing something just for ourselves. Krakenjs and a few of our other modules came from this."*

* *"There were other benefits which were realized, of course, e.g. needing less server capacity, faster response times, involvement in the open source node community; but the one which we hadn’t considered was developer joy."*

* *"the average team is fully end to end at this point."*

* *"Full stack developers thrive in environments which allow them to be autonomous and in control. This allows them to choose the right tool for the job and make the decisions required to scale their app the way it needs to be. We’re working to further empower our engineers at PayPal exactly for these reasons."*
