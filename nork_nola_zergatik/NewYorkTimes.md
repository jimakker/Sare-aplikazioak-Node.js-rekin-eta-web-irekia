* Times Video eta Video API
    
* *"There was a centralized SVN repo with every project. We migrated to GitHub, and it changed our lives. It was way easier to improve our code review process via pull requests and increase collaboration across teams. Not to say, developers focused on open source cried with joy the day we started using GitHub."*

* *"This is the perfect segue into a discussion of our deployment process. Deployments used to happen biweekly, and all of our web apps were deployed together. They required a lot of coordination between different teams and SVN branches. Plus, there were no automated tests whatsoever. Every deployment was a ritual that could take up to a day and needed several engineers from different teams."*

* *"Continuous Delivery is the best thing I’ve seen happening at The Times. We drastically changed the way we write and deliver software. Test-driven development, pair programming and other XP good practices are now part of our culture. The high confidence in our code base with stable continuous integration means that one engineer can deploy a new feature to production in under 20 minutes, and there are no fingers crossed."*

* *"It’s pretty recent, but some of us, including the video team, are moving from feature branches to trunk based development."*

* *"It’s tremendously useful for The Times, especially for the video team. Most of the over-the-top devices, Smart TVs and Digital Media Players (such as Chromecast) support JavaScript (or a subset of it). Those that do not may create an SDK for it in the future."*

* *"Modularization via Node Modules was a big win as well"*

* *"I’d be lying if I said that we had no issues when we started using it, especially in the early days. The first time we had a memory leak in the application, we were all pretty sad. It was — and still is — really hard to debug the application built in Node. And despite all the improvements in Node.js, it is still a young project. "*
